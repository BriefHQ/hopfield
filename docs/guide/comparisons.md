# Comparisons

No other library does what Hopfield does (inferring TypeScript types from Zod schemas), but there are some similarities with other libraries. This page compares Hopfield to other libraries.

Comparisons strive to be as accurate and as unbiased as possible. If you use any of these libraries and feel the information could be improved, feel free to suggest changes.

<!-- [**TypeChain**](https://github.com/dethcrypto/TypeChain) is a command-line tool that generates types and runtime wrappers for popular libraries at build time. People often use the generated types to cast values (e.g. `new Contract(â€¦) as TypeChainType`). **Hopfield** is a TypeScript library that infers static types from any ABI using type-level programming. -->

<!-- Below is a comparison of the libraries's type-level features:

|                 | TypeChain                                | Hopfield                   |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Lifecycle Step  | Generated at build time                  | Inferred at compile time   |
| ABI Source      | Path(s) to CLI command                   | Directly reference in code |
| Type Generation | Iterates through ABIs and builds strings | Static from type-level     | -->
